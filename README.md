Survey App built for Elemetric

# Identify Yourself

A simple survey app built with React.

# Requirements

* Exhibits 3 different question types (Multiple Choice with Pictures, Free Response, Multi-Select)
* Allows users to go back and forth between questions to change answers
* Progress indication
* No need for a database, answers are saved locally

## Challenges

I set everything up and proceeded to get started on the project. I went to do a test and could not get anything to show up on the browser. I tried different strategies and moved code around to get something to appear but to no avail. I proceeded to code the application anyway to demonstrate my resourcefulness and understanding of the concepts. The code is commented as appropriate.
